        <h2>Assignment 0: Add Two Numbers Script</h2>
        <p>
          In Assignment 0, I wrote a python script that adds two numbers
          together and prints their sum to terminal.

          Assignment 3: SVD Preprocessing on MNIST with Logistic Regression
        </h2>
        <p>
          In Assignment 3, I applied Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) as a
          preprocessing step to the MNIST dataset, trained a logistic regression
          classifier, and compared the model performance and training time when
          using different levels of SVD for dimensionality reduction.

        <p>
          In Assignment 4, I developed an interactive web application that
          implements a basic search engine using Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA).
          The search engine will take a user's query, perform LSA on a pool of
          documents, and return the top documents based on cosine similarity.

        <h2>Assignment 5: Predicting Customer Churn Using KNN</h2>
        <p>
          In this assignment, I developed a predictive model to identify
          customers who are likely to churn (i.e., leave the bank) using the
          K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm. Customer churn is a significant
          problem in the banking industry, as retaining customers is often more
          cost-effective than acquiring new ones. By accurately predicting which
          customers are likely to churn, banks can take proactive steps to
          improve customer retention.

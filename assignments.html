        <h2>Assignment 0: Add Two Numbers Script</h2>
        <p>
          In Assignment 0, I wrote a python script that adds two numbers
          together and prints their sum to terminal.

          Assignment 3: SVD Preprocessing on MNIST with Logistic Regression

          In Assignment 3, I applied Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) as a
          preprocessing step to the MNIST dataset, trained a logistic regression
          classifier, and compared the model performance and training time when
          using different levels of SVD for dimensionality reduction.

          In Assignment 4, I developed an interactive web application that
          implements a basic search engine using Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA).
          The search engine will take a user's query, perform LSA on a pool of
          documents, and return the top documents based on cosine similarity.

        <h2>Assignment 5: Predicting Customer Churn Using KNN</h2>
        <p>
          In this assignment, I developed a predictive model to identify
          customers who are likely to churn (i.e., leave the bank) using the
          K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm. Customer churn is a significant
          problem in the banking industry, as retaining customers is often more
          cost-effective than acquiring new ones. By accurately predicting which
          customers are likely to churn, banks can take proactive steps to
          improve customer retention.

        <h2>Assignment 6: Linear Regression</h2>

          In this assignment, I'll explore the impact of changing parameters on
          linear regression. The goal is to create an interactive webpage to
          demonstrate how modifying these parameters affects regression results,
          especially when there is no actual relationship between X and Y.

        </h2>
        <p>
          In this assignment, I’ll extend the previous work from Assignment 6 to
          include hypothesis testing and confidence intervals through
          simulations. I’ll enhance the interactive webpage to allow users to
          perform hypothesis tests on the slope or intercept of the regression
          line and generate confidence intervals based on simulations.

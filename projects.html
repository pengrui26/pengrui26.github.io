        <p><strong>Abstract:</strong></p>
        <p>
          The proliferation of medical podcasts has generated an extensive
          repository of audio content, rich in specialized terminology, diverse
          medical topics, and expert dialogues. MedPodGPT is a computational
          framework designed to enhance large language models (LLMs) by
          leveraging the informational content of publicly accessible medical
          podcast data. This dataset, comprising over 4,300 hours of audio
          content, was transcribed to generate over 39 million text tokens. Our
          model integrates the varied dialogue found in medical podcasts to
          improve understanding of natural language nuances, cultural contexts,
          and medical knowledge. MedPodGPT demonstrated an average improvement
          of 2.31% over standard open-source benchmarks and showcased an
          improvement of 2.58% in its zero-shot multilingual transfer ability.

        <p><strong>My Role:</strong></p>
        <p>
          I was responsible for determining and preparing the medical training
          datasets required for the model, focusing on curating and processing
          various medical podcast datasets. In addition to dataset preparation,
          I actively participated in the model's training process and
          contributed to the evaluation of its accuracy and performance across
          multiple benchmarks.

          The Impact of Economic Factors on Native Obesity Rates: Multivariate
          Linear Regression Analysis
        </h2>

        <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
        <p>
          This project analyzed the impact of economic factors on obesity rates
          across 100 countries using multivariate linear regression. The
          analysis involved formulating hypotheses related to food imports, GDP,
          CPI, and minimum calorie requirements, and interpreting the complex
          relationships between these economic factors and obesity rates.
        </p>

        <p><strong>My Role:</strong></p>
        <p>
          I led the team in conducting the statistical analysis using JMP
          software, managed large datasets, and spearheaded the variable
          selection process using stepwise regression. I collaborated on data
          cleaning, handled outliers, and tested hypotheses, ultimately building
          a model with an adjusted RÂ² of 0.732431, demonstrating that 73.2% of
          the variability in obesity rates could be predicted from the
          independent variables.
